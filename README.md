Team Workflow: 

Our team follows agile methodologies and employs the Scrum framework to ensure efficient and collaborative work processes. We use a Miro board to manage our Kanban board and backlog, enabling transparent and organized task tracking.

Daily Schedule:

To maintain a structured and productive workflow, we adhere to the following daily schedule:

Daily Stand-up: 9:00 AM - 9:15 AM
A brief meeting where each team member shares what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers they are facing.

Sprint Review: 5:45 PM - 6:00 PM
A daily review of the progress made, ensuring alignment with sprint goals and addressing any immediate issues.

Scrum Framework
We follow the core principles of Scrum to manage our development process:

Sprints: Time-boxed iterations, typically lasting two weeks, during which we deliver a potentially shippable increment of the product.
Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, we plan the tasks and set goals for the upcoming sprint.
Daily Stand-ups: Short, focused meetings to synchronize the team and plan the dayâ€™s activities.
Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, we review the work completed and gather feedback from stakeholders.
Sprint Retrospective: After the sprint review, we reflect on the sprint to identify areas for improvement and celebrate successes.
Tools

Miro Board: Used for managing our Kanban board and backlog, providing a visual and interactive platform for tracking progress and prioritizing tasks.
